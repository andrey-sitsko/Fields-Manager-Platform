- Original images are in `new-photos`, labeled images are in `new-photos-out`. To edit the annotations or proceed to labeling more data, install [labelme](https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme). If there are any issues with the PyQt dependency, consider installing PySide2, as the prompt suggests.
- For model training, you will need to expand the annotation JSONs into masks. The script `postprocess_labeled_images.sh` should do this for you.
- The Jupyter notebook `crops_health_estimation.ipynb` contains model training logic and some exploratory code. Probably the easiest way to handle all dependencies of this notebook is to install Anaconda â€“ most modules should be available in it right away, and the rest can be installed via `pip install`.
- The script `process_image.py` is the backend server for image processing in runtime. It should be possible to install its requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. API call syntax and example calls are provided in the source code of the script.
